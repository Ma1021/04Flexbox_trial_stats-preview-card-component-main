## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

1. Different image for different screen size

I first thought of using display none then show --> but this will load both of the image

Solution provided by changing background image of the div --> no need to load both of the images (cannot print out)
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30460681/changing-image-src-depending-on-screen-size
May be I will use this one (I am not too familiar with this one)

2. Add filter to the image

First I thought of  filter, but it is using customized filter instead of adding the color filter on my own.

Then I use the two layer method, adding opacity to the photo --> but the color is so different??

3. Flex-shrink

4. Extra length in viewport height and width

from browser --> my normalize???

5. Mystical left space for list
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9111204/align-list-item-to-the-left-in-unordered-list 


6. Putting footer in the right place 

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32551291/in-css-flexbox-why-are-there-no-justify-items-and-justify-self-properties/33856609#33856609


https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40890613/remove-space-gaps-between-multiple-lines-of-flex-items-when-they-wrap

before is the first child of selected element
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::before

7. Centralize the background image

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2643305/centering-a-background-image-using-css

8. Mobile device size, flex will not expand the container

https://css-tricks.com/boxes-fill-height-dont-squish/

9. Is it better to do it with flex-shrink/flex-grow??????

could they work out without width of child container?

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
